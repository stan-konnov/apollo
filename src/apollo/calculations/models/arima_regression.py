# The basic ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model does not incorporate
# exogenous variables. It's a univariate time series model that predicts future values
# based solely on the past values of the same time series.

# However, there are extensions of ARIMA that allow for the inclusion of exogenous variables.
# One such extension is the SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors)
# model. SARIMAX extends ARIMA by incorporating exogenous variables that may help improve
# the forecast accuracy by capturing additional information not present in the time series itself.

# Here's how you can use SARIMAX in Python with exogenous variables:

"""
from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX

# Assuming you have a time series dataframe 'df' with columns 'Y' and 'X'
# 'Y' represents the endogenous time series, and 'X' represents the exogenous variable

# Define the SARIMAX model
model = SARIMAX(df['Y'], exog=df['X'], order=(p, d, q), seasonal_order=(P, D, Q, m))

# Fit the model
results = model.fit()

# Generate forecasts
forecast = results.forecast(steps=n_steps, exog=exog_data)
