* Use Adj Close for calculations
* Privatize field
* Unit tests for api connector, calculators, backtesting
* Break down base params and strategy params into separate files

Missing calculations that didn't prove themselves, but worth trying again:

* RSI
* Markov Chains
* Support Resistance
* Accumulative Swing Index
